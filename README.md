In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".  

I created create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset 

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  <br />

For the second challenge (PyPoll), I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast: **369,711**

A complete list of candidates who received votes:

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote: <br />

<br />
I then exported the results to a .txt file <br />
